1. Register and log in using a secure JWT-based authentication system.

2. Browse products, view details, and add them to a cart.

3. Manage their shopping cart (add, update, remove items).

4. Place orders which are saved to a MongoDB database.

5. An admin can manage products (add, edit, delete).
